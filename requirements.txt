# versions that pip freeze outputs from your working virtual environment
# for maximum reproducibility, e.g.:
# fastapi==0.115.12
# uvicorn==0.34.2
# requests==2.32.3

# Pip will automatically install transitive dependencies (dependencies of these packages).
# For example, 'starlette' is a dependency of 'fastapi' and will be installed automatically.
